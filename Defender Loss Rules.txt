The order of losses for the defender is as follows:

Land units:
AA gun
Infantry
Artillery
Armour
Bomber
Fighter

Sea units:
Undamaged battleship
Submarine
Destroyer
Cruiser
Unnecessary carrier (a carrier is unnecessary if all fighters could still land without it)
Fighter
Damaged battleship

Allied units of the same type:
American
British
Russian

Axis units of the same type:
German
Japanese

Exception: when choosing between two carriers of different nationalities, choose the one that minimizes the number of fighters that will have to land on carriers not of their nationality.

Defending submarines submerge if and only if there are no other defending ships (including transports).
