Given the nature of correspondence play, the defender is unable to choose losses
in a battle, so the following rules are used to choose losses for the defender.
The attacker may choose their losses as usual.

Order of losses on land:
AA Gun
Infantry
Artillery
Armour
Bomber
Fighter

Order of losses at sea:
Undamaged battleship
Submarine
Destroyer
Cruiser
Unnecessary carrier¹
Fighter
Carrier
Damaged battleship

Defending submarines submerge if and only if there are no other defending ships
(including transports).

The attacker chooses the nationality of lost units in cases where multiple
nations have defending units of the type to be lost.

¹A carrier is unnecessary if the number of friendly carriers remaining in the
zone after its destruction is at least half the number of friendly fighters in
the zone.
